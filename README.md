# OneeChan-4chanXT-Icon-inserter
A userscript to add back the OneeChan Settings link for 4chanXT.

Unlike 4chanX, which uses FontAwesome to render icons, 4chanXT uses inline svg. Unfortunately, OneeChan also uses FontAwesome which, of course, doesn't work on 4chanXT. This userscript waits until OneeChan adds it's own Settings link and makes some changes to that HTML element.
